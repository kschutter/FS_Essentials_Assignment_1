Web Development Essentials Assignment 1

How do client and server communicate? Explain why DNS is required?
	Clients, the computer or browser that needs information, will first need to find 
	the Server Address, or IP address of that server. Because IP addresses are so numerous,
	as well as dynamic, the DNS (domain name server) is required. The unique string representation
	of the requested server (ie google.com) will be sent to the DNS by the client, which returns 
	the current IP address of the target. Once the client knows the IP address, it can send requests
	to that address, usually for the homepage. The response will typically come in the form of an html file.
